                Renzel is an earnest guy. He is a simple guy, humble, modest, and affable. You could see him most of the time hanging around Duerr hall. Sangkaway, sangkindat. If you say hi, wave, or acknowledge him, he'll greet you with a wink. This guy. He's full of confidence that's about as huge as his heart. He spends most of his time playing the guitar, eating and playing video games. 
<br><br>
Renzel is in his third year taking up BS-Information Systems. Originally, he wanted to be a game developer but due to lack of slots, he opted to enroll into the Information Systems course in hopes of shifting to the Game Development program after the first year. Despite that, Renzel has grown to be a capable developer. He utilizes a mobile first development approach and a top-down design approach. "I start from scratch, top to bottom, keeping in mind the functionalities first. I create a div, fill it up, div-fill, div-fill." He wanted to take up GDD because he liked the idea of creating art and being able to develop game logic and design as well. He carried over these abilities into Information Systems and can clearly be seen in his web application designs. 
<br>
                    <br>
Renzel has a dream. A big one too. He wants to create a startup company two to three years from now to develop technology. "Disruptive technology" that will change the norm. Maybe he'll create gaming peripherals that can simulate sensations or experiences. Who knows?
